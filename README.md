# Building Products that Transforms Businesses & Empowers People ‚Ä¢ Creative Storyteller ‚Ä¢ Growth Product Manager ‚Ä¢ Pitch Deck Expert #

_My aim for every product is to build an audience of customers that share the product mission._

_I live by this principle:_

_‚ÄúGenuinely be the best at what I do.‚Äù_

_Work with the best company. Collaborate with the best team. Be the best PM any company could hire. Create the best product._

_At the end of the day, my goal is to bring products to life. Viewing a product or feature from the user‚Äôs eyes, creating an optimized experience, and building ‚Äòwow‚Äô products get me up from bed_

When you genuinely create the best product, you‚Äôll find out that the burden of campaigning is far lighter because the product speaks for itself.

What was once part of your customers will become part of your army, defending your product and mission because it‚Äôs now their product and mission.

```` I like to solve problems. My intellectual curiosity has driven me to find answers to the most pressing questions throughout my career. Whether relating to the market trend for a product or finding a rare, unique selling point for a brand, I‚Äôve been able to quickly uncover a customer‚Äôs pain point, develop a story around a product, and generate over 47% increase in revenue for businesses.````

I‚Äôm a highly motivated individual who is very driven to find the gap and come up with practical solutions geared toward bringing projects to life. I‚Äôve worked extensively in various industries that include but are not limited to non-profit, for-profit, technical-savvy brands, and finance/business development, having gained experience in the following functions along the way - UI/UX Design, marketing, business analysis, operations, and advertising.

4+ years of experience working as a Growth Product Manager for top listed companies with experience in capital fundraising, investor relations, financial analysis, sales, and reporting.

I like to think that it‚Äôs my real-world experience that sets me apart. These experiences give me unique insight into what people want and how to create user-focused products.

For a cross-functional team, great collaboration is mandatory. I exhibit emotional intelligence to help teams work well together and achieve a high-performing state.

As a leader, on a more personal level, I love building teams that are driven by the power found at the intersection of technology & marketing. My willingness to serve customers selflessly has led me to create stories and strategies to unlock new growth.
